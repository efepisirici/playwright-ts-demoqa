## PrerequisitesüöÄ
- Node.js installed on the system.
- npm (Node Package Manager) for managing project dependencies.
- Playwright Test Runner for executing the tests.

Make sure to install all project dependencies by running `npm install`.

## Notes

- The `afterEach` hook is commented out. If browser closure after each test is required, this can be uncommented.
- The `expect.soft` assertions are used for scenarios where the test should continue even when the assertion fails, allowing for multiple checks within a single test.

## Running the Tests
